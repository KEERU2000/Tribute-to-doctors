             <P class="name">Dr. Li Wenliang</P>
             <p class="Info">
                The death that broke several hearts in the initial days of coronavirus spread was of Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist who tried to warn fellow practitioners about the 
                potential outbreak of a virus. Unfortunately, he was accused of making false claims and misleading the public. Dr. Li's warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive 
                imaging studies, but on his own understanding of biological plausibility—the kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties
                 could make. The New York Times reported that on January 10, 2020, Dr Li developeda cough after
                  having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter. 
                 No report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patient.<br>
                 <img src="Dr_li.jpg"><br>
                 The 34-year-old eye specialist, in his Weibo story, revealed how he had come down with cough and fever after a month of his warning going unnoticed.<br><br>
                 The doctor had contracted the virus while treating a glaucoma case (suffering from corona virus) in Wuhan. Dr. Li passed away on February 7,
                  2020 leaving the people in China and worldwide grieving and angry.<br><br>
                 Another doctor who died of the disease in Wuhan was just 29 years old.
                  As per the reports, he had postponed his Lunar New Year marriage to serve humanity and treat patients who had been hit by the virus.
                 Unfortunately, he ended up contracting the virus from one of his patients and died a hero.

             <P class="Info">
                Jean-Jacques Razafindranazy was the first French doctor who died while treating coronavirus patients. The 68-year-old accident and emergency department
                doctor was retired but the passion that he had for serving humanity was undying. Thus, he volunteered to help his colleagues save the lives of people, as the number of incoming patients continued to increase.<br>

                The retired doctor was working in an emergency ward at the Lille University Hospital where he caught the disease. His death was announced through a social media post titled “My Father: A Hero“ written by his family.
